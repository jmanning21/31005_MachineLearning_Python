##Selected Question: Question 3
*Marketing or advertising companies would be very interested in being able to predict whether a Twitter message will spread as a meme 
or not, and even better, construct it so that it will spread. Why is this a hard problem to solve? Describe two approaches using data 
analytics to predict whether a tweet will go viral or not. How would you validate these approaches? Discuss the ethical and social 
consequences of this study.*

###1. __Why is this a hard problem to solve?__
There are multiple aspects that need to be considered when solving this problem. One of the major problems is retrieving the data. 
According to Sayce (2019), there are roughly 500 million tweets sent every day, therefore making it difficult to retrieve such a large 
number of data within a short amount of time, as the life-span of each tweet is relatively short, only lasting 24 minutes before it 
becomes less relevant. The tweets are also in a non-structured format which makes it more difficult to retrieve the data compared to the 
traditional structured format, however Twitter does supply information in relation to API calls. These API calls make the retrieval of 
data easier for the developer and consist of multiple options such as:
- Search for historical tweets,
- Monitoring account activity,
- Filter real-time tweets, 
- Build customised Direct Messages, and
- Embedding tweets and timelines into websites (Twitter, 2019).

The second problem is handling the large amounts of data made available. With this problem comes the flow-on effect of a large 
computational cost. The proposed method would have to not only convert the unstructured data into a structured and readable format, but 
it would also have to determine what is deemed a "viral" tweet in creating relationships to the data with ther factors. These factors 
include the number of followers, the number of retweets and the number of mentions for each individual user or their tweets. Due to the 
large size of the assumed dataset, this process would take a significant amount of time to compute and process, in order to receive any 
output.

The third problem is filtering the large dataset into a reasonable and legitimate size without placing any bias or manipulation strategies 
on the dataset. As the dataset is large in size, there would need to be some sort of filtering applied not only the the contents of the 
tweets, but the numbers of tweets as well. The developer would need to make the decision on which the filtering occurred and what tweets 
would be included. This relates to the language of the tweet, the length of the tweet, the contents of the tweet, the number of followers 
the individual had, and what timeframe will be analysed to determine the most appropriate and accurate result.

###4. __Discuss the ethical and social consequences of this study__
When collecting data from Twitter there are several ethical and social consequences that may arise from this study. The first potential 
consequence would be that personal information about the individual could be collected in the data retrieval process. In the perfect 
scenario, any personal information would not be collected, and the tweets would be anonymised. However, quite often individuals have 
multiple social media accounts connected to each other and information could be collected unknowingly throughout the data collection 
stage. This additional collected information could de-anonymise the individual and their tweets, therefore making their personal 
information readily available to others without them knowing. This example raises the concern of privacy around the process of 
retrieving these tweets from individuals, as either approach could be used to exploit the data and information collected from the user.

It is also difficult to monitor and regulate the data and information that is being collected by individuals, groups and third-party 
organisations that use social media applications for marketing purposes. This raises the question as to whether these approaches are 
ethically and socially acceptable and appropriate, as there can be several consequences for individuals if their data and information 
is misused, including identity theft and misuse of personal data for company gains or profits.
